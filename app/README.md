## Markdown

The markdown used on the presentation files support most of the [GitHub Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) and adds some especial html comment tags to edit styles and control effects that are explained on the [reveal.js markdown docs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#markdown).

**Important:** You can use all html tags on the presentation files, but some block tags can present unexpected behavior.
